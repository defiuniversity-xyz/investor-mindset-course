⚡ The Pre-Trade Bias Checklist (2 minutes before every trade)
Print this and keep it visible:

Before ANY DeFi investment, ask yourself:

□ Am I seeking information that confirms what I want to believe? (Confirmation Bias)

□ Is this decision driven by recent price movements or social media? (FOMO/Recency Bias)

□ Am I risking more than my predetermined position size limits? (Overconfidence)

□ Have I considered equally credible opposing viewpoints? (Confirmation Bias)

□ Is my timeline realistic given market cycles? (Recency Bias)

□ Am I holding a loser hoping for recovery? (Loss Aversion)

□ Am I chasing because others are making money? (FOMO/Herd Mentality)

□ Am I anchored to purchase price or ATH instead of current reality? (Anchoring Bias)

If you answered YES to any question, STOP and address that bias before proceeding.

📈 Livermore's Bias Wisdom Integration

"The market does not beat them. They beat themselves."

Livermore's Most Expensive Biases

Overconfidence After Success
After major wins, Livermore increased position sizes dangerously.

Your Protection: After significant gains, maintain or reduce position sizes for next 3 trades.

Commitment: "After winning more than $_____ in a single trade, I will not increase position sizes for 3 trades."

Loss Aversion in Cotton
Livermore held losing cotton positions far too long, hoping for recovery.

Your Protection: Set stops before entry, honor them without exception.

Commitment: "I will set stop losses before every entry and exit at stops without hesitation or hope."

Confirmation Bias with Tips
Livermore sometimes sought tips confirming his existing positions.

Your Protection: Research to disprove your thesis, not confirm it.

Commitment: "Before adding to any position, I will find 3 credible sources arguing against it."

📖 Book Integration Exercises

🧠 From Thinking, Fast and Slow (Kahneman)

System 1 vs System 2 Trading
System 1 (fast, emotional, biased) makes most of your mistakes.
System 2 (slow, deliberate, analytical) makes most of your profits.

Your System 1 Trading Triggers:
1. _______________________________________________
2. _______________________________________________
3. _______________________________________________

Your System 2 Protection:
Mandatory 2-minute pause before any trade to activate deliberate thinking.

💡 From Predictably Irrational (Ariely)

The Relativity Trap in DeFi
You judge protocols relative to recent prices, not absolute value.

Exercise: For your 3 largest holdings, answer: "If I had cash today equal to this position value, would I buy this protocol at current prices?"

Position 1: ______ Yes/No - Action: ______________
Position 2: ______ Yes/No - Action: ______________
Position 3: ______ Yes/No - Action: ______________

📚 From The Art of Thinking Clearly (Dobelli)

Bias Catalog Study
Read one bias chapter daily. After each, ask: "How has this bias cost me money in DeFi?"
