🧠 Phase 4: System Psychology Management (15 minutes)

The Pre-Commitment Contract

"I, ______________, commit to following my documented trading system for the next 90 days without deviation.

I understand that:

If I deviate from the system, I will:
1. Document the deviation and reason
2. Calculate the cost in dollars
3. Review with accountability partner
4. Recommit to system for 7 days before next decision

I will review and update my system only on scheduled dates:
Monthly review: First ______ of each month

Annual overhaul: _________

No changes outside these scheduled times."

□ Adding complexity constantly

Checked items: ___ (If >3, you're at risk of abandonment)

The System Adherence Reaffirmation:

When tempted to deviate, ask:

2. "What would my system say about this situation?"
3. "How would I feel if this deviation costs me money?"
4. "Am I changing a losing system or sabotaging a winning one?"

If answers don't clearly support deviation, follow your system.
