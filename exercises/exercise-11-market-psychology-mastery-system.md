"The crowd is right during trends but wrong at turning points. Your edge comes from knowing the difference. Be greedy when others are fearful, fearful when others are greedy. Position size inversely to comfort. Follow smart money, not loud money."

The greatest fortunes are built by understanding what everyone else is feeling — and doing the opposite at extremes.
