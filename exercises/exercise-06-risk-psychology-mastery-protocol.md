🔍 Phase 1: Personal Risk Psychology Assessment (15 minutes)
Your True Risk Tolerance Discovery

Before you can manage risk properly, you must know your actual risk tolerance — not what you think it is, but what it really is under stress.

💀 The Three Risk Types Assessment

Ruin Risk Evaluation
Rate your current situation 1-10 (1=extremely risky, 10=very safe):

□ My largest single position is ____% of my portfolio ___/10
   (10=<2%, 7=2-5%, 5=5-10%, 3=10-20%, 1=>20%)

□ I could lose my largest position completely and continue trading ___/10

□ I never use leverage on volatile DeFi assets ___/10

□ I only invest capital I can afford to lose 100% ___/10

□ My portfolio drawdown tolerance is ____% before I quit ___/10

📊 Ruin Risk Score: ___/50 (Below 35 = DANGER ZONE)

Most dangerous position right now:

Protocol: _________________________________________

Position size: ____% of portfolio

If this went to zero tomorrow:
□ I'd be fine and continue
□ I'd be stressed but survive
□ I'd be financially/psychologically devastated

Emotional Risk Evaluation
Rate yourself 1-10 (1=completely emotional, 10=completely calm):

□ I never make impulsive decisions during big swings ___/10

□ My position sizes don't cause me constant anxiety ___/10

□ I can watch a position drop 30% without panic ___/10

📊 Emotional Risk Score: ___/50 (Below 35 = Positions too large)

Position causing most emotional distress:

Protocol: _________________________________________

Anxiety level (1-10): ___/10

Times checked today: _____

Sleep quality impact (1-10): ___/10

Opportunity Risk Evaluation
Rate yourself 1-10:

□ My positions are large enough to create meaningful wealth ___/10

□ I'm not over-trading due to position sizes being too small ___/10

□ My risk capital is appropriately allocated (not too conservative) ___/10

😴 The Emotional Sizing Tests

The Sleep Test

Position: ____________  Sleep Impact (1-10): ___
If 8-10 (ruins sleep) = Position too large, reduce by 50%

Position: ____________  Sleep Impact (1-10): ___
Position: ____________  Sleep Impact (1-10): ___
Position: ____________  Sleep Impact (1-10): ___
Position: ____________  Sleep Impact (1-10): ___

Positions requiring reduction: _______________________

The Comfort Zone Test
Rate emotional state for each position (1-10):
• 1-3 = Too small to care
• 4-7 = Optimal psychological size
• 8-10 = Overleveraged emotionally

Position: ____________  Emotional State: ___/10  Action: ______
Position: ____________  Emotional State: ___/10  Action: ______
Position: ____________  Emotional State: ___/10  Action: ______
Position: ____________  Emotional State: ___/10  Action: ______

The "Zero Tomorrow" Test
For each position, complete: "If this went to zero tomorrow, I would feel..."

Position 1: ___________________________________________
Feeling: □ Fine (good size)  □ Stressed (too large)  □ Devastated (way too large)

Position 2: ___________________________________________
Feeling: □ Fine (good size)  □ Stressed (too large)  □ Devastated (way too large)

Position 3: ___________________________________________
Feeling: □ Fine (good size)  □ Stressed (too large)  □ Devastated (way too large)

Position 4: ___________________________________________
Feeling: □ Fine (good size)  □ Stressed (too large)  □ Devastated (way too large)

Position 5: ___________________________________________
Feeling: □ Fine (good size)  □ Stressed (too large)  □ Devastated (way too large)

Any position marked "Devastated" = Reduce immediately to 50% or less
Any position marked "Stressed" = Reduce to achieve "Fine" status

Signed: _________________ Date: _______

Emotional Sizing Check:

Your loss aversion impact assessment:
How many times have you held losers too long? _____
Average additional loss from holding: $______
Total cost of loss aversion this year: $______
